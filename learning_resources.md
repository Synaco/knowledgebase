# Learning Resources

There's a treasure trove of information out on the internet. Some are
free, some not so much. Some will better prepare for the
workforce/career side of things, others feed the itch to learn and
tinker. The list below are resources I've found (either organically or
through others suggestions) that fit into one category or both for me.
