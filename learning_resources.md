# Learning Resources

There's a treasure trove of information out on the internet. Some 
resources are free; some, not so much. Some will better prepare you 
for the workforce or a career, while others feed the itch to learn and 
tinker. The list below is made up of resources I've found---either 
organically or through others' suggestions---that fit into one or both 
of those categories for me
